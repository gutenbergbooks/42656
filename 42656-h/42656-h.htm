</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Christ taught no worship and believed in none;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Christ did not ask for worship, nor it seek;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Satan still tempts all greedy human kind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With his rewards of selfishness and lust;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He would their minds in superstition steep,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And mercilessly every soul would keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever to the lower realms confined,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where all is turned to ashes and to dust.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh! what a world of malice Christ awoke<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Around his earthly way exhaled their spell;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">Pg 7</a></span>
<span class="i0">Beset by every snare hell could evoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He suffered hellish tortures of the mind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He lived alone; he was not understood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By those with whom he most communed and taught;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His sole support was love and faith in truth<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And principles he'd pondered from his youth;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Must bring a future life with gladness fraught.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But hell would not consent to tolerate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The presence here on earth of one who chose<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To be so independent of its sway;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">It would not do to longer let him stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so the vicious tools of hell and hate<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He long had seen or guessed how it would end;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But faith in principle in him was strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And he would not consent to change his course<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nor to retract, nor turn to such resource<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As would the purpose of his foes unbend,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thus his labors on the earth prolong.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he resolved to carry on the fight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beyond the grave, and to contend for power<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And freedom to reject the homage base<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Which Satan claimed, and meet him face to face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his own realms of cruelty and night,<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">Pg 8</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was a faith sublime that thus could nerve<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Nazarene to face the death they chose;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But patiently he met his fate alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Without complaint, and scarcely gave a groan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sure was he that Freedom he could serve<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in the end could conquer all his foes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was not long before the end was reached,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So far as earth could end his grand career;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How to annul the doctrines he had preached<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lest they forever should torment them here.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they resolved upon a double course&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i4">The bloody cross as symbol of their views,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Of all their power&mdash;His name made a decoy.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Must have rejoiced their bloody course to see,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To blind belief they added blinder faith,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">The world bowed down before religion's pow'r,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And truthfully the page of history saith<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mankind gave up to riots and to raids.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Who rated virtue lower than the beasts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pollution of the maiden or the dame<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When Satan's agents found no pagan foe,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such scenes the world had never known before,<br /></span>
